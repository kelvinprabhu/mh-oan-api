Agricultural Economics 78. The millet export from India is diversified with less international trade risk and has competitive advantage. The most stable and reliable markets for Indian millets are • UK and Nepal for Indian Sorghum with 84.09 per cent and 77.08 per cent export retention, • UAE, Saudi Arab and Yemen for Indian Bajara with 87.36%, 82.93%, and 66.19% export retention and • Nepal for Ragi with 89.07% export retention. Therefore, it is recommended to increase the export of these millets to above mentioned countries. 79. In Maharashtra, the total cost of sorghum, and ragi cultivation has increased with the annual rate of 8 to 10 per cent due to increase in cost incurred on labour, with 7 to 9 per cent per annum growth in gross returns from millet cultivation. With 10 per cent increase in yield, cost of production of sorghum and ragi can be reduced by 15 per cent & 8 per cent.  Therefore, it is recommended to reduce labour inputs and use university recommended dose of seed and fertilizer.

 Agril. Extension Edication 81. "MPKV Idols" is a novel concept which comprises of depicting the innovative technologies adopted by progressive farmers. The transfer of these technologies among other farmers is done through success stories and use of mass media. It assists to motivate the rural youths, agricultural graduates and farmers to adopt these innovative technologies on their farms. Therefore, it is recommended that the other Agril. Universities and Institutes should also adopt this concept for effective transfer of agricultural technologies. 82. From the study of “ICAR Farmer FIRST (F- Farm, I- Innovations, R- Resources, S- Science and T- Technology) Programme”, it is revealed that the economic impact of the Phule Sangam variety of soybean has resulted in 45.45 % increase in production and economic returns to the participant farmers over the farmers practice due to adoption of demonstrated technology package. Therefore, it is recommended that the soybean growers should adopt the demonstrated technology package for more production and economic returns from soybean crop. The study on yield gap assessment in soybean crop on farmers field revealed that seed treatment of biofertilizer, moisture stress management, use of certified seed, foliar application of chemical fertilizers and Broad Bed Furrow (BBF) method of sowing are the critical factors that significantly contribute towards higher per hectare yield in Soybean. Therefore, it is recommended that farmers should follow above practices scrupulously so as to reduce their farm level yield gap in soybean crop. 83. It is observed that majority of the Grape Growers were not aware about the concept of ‘Pre-harvesting Interval’ about use of chemical pesticides and its norms. Therefore, it is recommended that Grape Growers Association and Extension Functionaries should make efforts for creating awareness regarding Pre-harvesting Interval and its norms and use of maximum Biopesticide products among Grape Growers. 84. The study revealed that majority of the pomegranate growers did not adopt pomegranate production system-based adaptation practices like bagging, sheltering of plants, use of anti-transpirants during extremes of weather. Hence, information on these modern adaptation strategies should be communicated to the farmers to cope with climate change and its variability. This information should be made accessible to pomegranate growers using various means of communication. 85. To bridge the yield gap in cotton, it is recommended that the Sustainable Cotton Technology Package which includes high-quality seed, bio-fertilizers, chemical fertilizers, biopesticides along with university recommended technology information booklet shall be made available and also to use mass media. Therefore, collective efforts should be made by the seed 
Page 14
 companies, biopesticide producing companies and extension agencies so as to ensure the successful implementation. 86. It was observed from study that, farmers were dependent on own farm seedlings and private farmer nurseries for seedlings as planting material, most of them were not aware about its seed certification category and faced constraints of lowavailability of credible planting material/nursery seedlings' and increasing infestation of grassy shoot disease. Therefore it is recommended that Sugar factories in coordination with university research stations (RSJRS, Kolhapur &CSRS, Padegaon) should make efforts to avail credible planting material (Sets/Seedlings) and trainings on Sugarcane Nursery Management should be provided to the sugarcane growers.  Agricultural Statistics 87. On the basis of path analysis, the highest contribution of vermicompost in the yield of rabi onion was found 25 and 79 per cent in both with and without fertilized plots respectively. Hence, an application of fertilizer nutrients as per STCR based yield target equations with vermicompost (5 t ha-1)(prepared on farmer’s own field) and liquid bio fertilizer (each 500 mlha-1Azotobacter and PSB) is recommended for obtaining higher yield of rabi onion, increasing fertilizer use efficiency and maintaining soil health. 88. On the basis of path analysis, in Halfbred cattle the direct significant contribution of age at first calving (AFC) in the milk yield was 6 to 22.41 per cent observed in all the six lactations. It also significantly affects the lactation milk yield (LMY) and lactation length (LL). Hence, it is recommended that farmers may give proper attention towards the age at first calving (850 to 950 days) to increase the milk yield of Halfbred cattle. 89. The ARIMA model is recommended for the exact future prediction of production and productivity of mango and papaya in Maharashtra State.  Biotic and Abiotic stress 90. Cotton genotype RHC 1409 is recommended as resistant source for jassids based on low infestation of jassids, morphological traits and biochemical parameters. 91. Pigeonpea variety BSMR 736 is recommended as resistant source for pulsebeetle based on low infestation of pulse beetle in seed storage ,morphological traits and biochemical parameters. 92. Chickpea variety Vijay is recommended as resistant source for pulse beetle based on low infestation of pulse beetle in seed storage ,morphological traits and biochemical parameters.  \*\*\*\*\*\*\* Page: [1](#1), [2](#2), [3](#3), [4](#4), [5](#5), [6](#6), [7](#7), [8](#8), [9](#9), [10](#10), [11](#11), [12](#12), [13](#13), [14](#14)
