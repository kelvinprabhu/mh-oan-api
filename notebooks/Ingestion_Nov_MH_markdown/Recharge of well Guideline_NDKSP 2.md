# Recharge of Well
## Introduction:
Climate change is observed to have an adverse impact on the agriculture in the state, and the scope of this impact is expected to increase in the future, as noted in the state's Climate Change Action Plan for Agriculture. Farmers in Marathwada and Vidarbha have been facing severe droughts for the past few years, which has adversely affected groundwater reserves and soil health. Consequently, the productivity of agricultural crops has decreased. Furthermore, the land in the Purna river basin is naturally saline, which limits irrigation for agriculture. In this adverse situation, it is observed that the productivity of smallholder farmers is being adversely affected. The Nanaji Deshmukh Krishi Sanjivani Prakalp has been launched by the Government of Maharashtra with financial assistance from the World Bank, with the objective of empowering farmers to adapt to the situation arising from climate change.
The rate of groundwater extraction is higher than the rate of recharge, and consequently, groundwater is not being replenished in proportion. As a result, the groundwater level has been progressively declining. To raise the groundwater level, it is necessary to make efforts to percolate rainwater wherever possible. Along with this, it is essential to use the available groundwater sparingly and in a scientific manner. To enable farmers to provide protective irrigation to crops, the recharge of well component for groundwater replenishment is being implemented as an individual benefit component under the World Bank-aided Nanaji Deshmukh Krishi Sanjivani Prakalp, to increase water availability in existing wells.
## Objectives:
1. To empower small and marginal farmers in the village clusters included in the Nanaji Deshmukh Krishi Sanjivani Prakalp to adapt to the situation arising from climate change.
2. To increase the groundwater level by recharging existing wells used for irrigation in the agricultural sector.
3. To conserve more water in drought-affected areas and improve the social and economic conditions of the people.
## Beneficiary Selection Criteria:
1. Beneficiaries will be selected from among farmers holding up to 5 hectares of land for the well recharge component under the project, in the priority order of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Women, Persons with Disabilities, and General.
2. Farmers who have previously availed benefits for this component from any other scheme will not be eligible for the benefit again.

## Technical Guidelines
a) Recharge of well -

1. While selecting wells, their depth should be sufficient to have completely penetrated the existing aquifer in that area, so that it is possible to artificially increase groundwater availability through well recharge.
2. This component should be implemented on a priority basis in locations where the water level in the wells is below an average of 4 meters in the month of October, so that it is possible to percolate water into the wells during the monsoon.
3. As many wells in the village as possible should be selected for this scheme collectively, so that the benefit can be immediately realized by the village.
4. While selecting wells, areas such as waterlogged areas, areas where the land has become saline due to excessive water use, and areas with pollution problems should be avoided.
5. Artificial recharge should be done only by using filter layers as shown in the conceptual diagram. This component should not be implemented without a filter layer.
6. The water entering the well through the filter should be free of silt. Also, it should not contain any pollutants. Care should be taken to ensure that water from garbage heaps or other wastewater does not enter the filter. Necessary preventive measures should be taken for this.
7. The filter should be constructed on the upstream side of the well.
8. While constructing the filter, care should be taken to ensure that it is strong and durable. Also, care should be taken that the well is not endangered during its excavation or while connecting it to the well; for this, an appropriate distance should be maintained between the well and the filter.
9. Arrangements like channels should be made as required to make the maximum amount of farm runoff water available for well recharge.
10. If there is a possibility of a very high volume of rainwater, surface water, or stream water flowing, arrangements should be made to divert the excess water away from the filter, so that the risk of flooding to the filter can be avoided.
# Preventive Measures:
1. If it rains very heavily, a system should be in place to release the excess water from the filter pit far away into a drain/outside the field.
2. A system should be in place to release only as much water into the filter pit as its capacity allows; for this, an arrangement should be made to bring only a portion of the water flowing into the field towards the filter pit.

3. An appropriate system should be in place to prevent sticks, garbage, or other silt from entering the filter pit.
4. In areas where the soil content is high, the necessary support should be provided to prevent soil from entering the filter pit.
5. If a large amount of silt has accumulated in the filter pit, the top layer of sand should be removed during the non-rainy season, washed with water, or the accumulated silt in the filter pit should be removed.
6. It is necessary for the farmer to continuously monitor the speed of the falling rain and the water entering the filter pit. Otherwise, the possibility of the filter pit filling up and muddy water entering the well cannot be denied.
7. A safe distance must be maintained between the filter pit and the well. The trench made to connect the filter pit to the well should be properly filled with stones after laying the PVC pipe and closed properly. Similarly, the point where the pipe is released into the well should also be properly sealed.
8. If there is a risk of a flood situation arising, all water coming towards the filter pit should be completely stopped and arrangements should be made for it to go outside the field or into the drain.
