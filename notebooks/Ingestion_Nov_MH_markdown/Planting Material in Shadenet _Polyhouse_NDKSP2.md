# Protected Cultivation
## (Planting material in Polyhouse / Shadenet house)
The adverse effects of climate change are visible on the agriculture of the state, and it is mentioned in the state's Climate Change Action Plan that the extent of these effects will increase in the future. Farmers in the Marathwada and Vidarbha regions have been facing severe droughts for the past few years, leading to adverse effects on groundwater reserves and soil health. Consequently, the productivity of agricultural crops is decreasing. This adverse situation has been observed to have a negative impact on the production of small and marginal land-holding farmers. The Nanaji Deshmukh Krishi Sanjivani Project has been initiated by the Maharashtra Government with financial assistance from the World Bank with the objective of enabling farmers to adapt to the situation arising from climate change.
The use of modern technology in Indian agriculture is increasing, and cultivation in alternative and controlled environments has gained great importance for sustainable and productive farming. With the help of shadenet houses and Polyhouse, protection is available from adverse climatic changes, uncertainty of rainfall, pest and disease outbreaks, extreme heat, or cold. This increases both the quality and quantity of produce, enables efficient use of water and fertilizers, and promotes year-round cultivation. The adoption of protected cultivation methods in the horticulture sector leads to an increase in the income of farmers by yielding more production, higher productivity, and highquality produce of flower and vegetable crops. Farmers use Polyhouse, shadenet houses, plastic tunnels, etc., for floriculture, vegetables, and nurseries. By selecting the appropriate planting material and following management practices, significant improvements can be achieved in agricultural production. The use of Polyhouse and shadenet houses results in the production of high-quality flowers and vegetables, leading to better yields in smaller areas for farmers. Therefore, the "Planting material in Polyhouse and Shadenet house" component helps farmers to adapt to the situation arising from climate change.
## Objectives:
1. To enable farmers in the village clusters included in the Nanaji Deshmukh Krishi Sanjivani Project to adapt to the situations arising from climate change.
2. To provide financial assistance to farmers for the cultivation of high-quality and high-grade exportable crops.
3. To make self-employment available to the youth in rural areas in the agriculture sector.
4. To encourage farmers to take up off-season crops and use high technology in the horticulture sector.

5. To create self-reliant farming and financial stability by using modern technology.
# Beneficiary Selection Criteria:
1. Farmers with land holdings up to 5 hectares will be eligible for this component under the project.
2. If a beneficiary has previously availed benefits under any government scheme (N.H.M. / N.H.B. / ATMA / R.K.V.Y. / Jalsudhar Project / Nanaji Deshmukh Krishi Sanjivani Project / others), under all schemes combined, the subsidy benefit is payable up to a maximum area of 4000 sq.m. per beneficiary. Accordingly, for the Polyhouse and shadenet house planting material category, the benefit of this scheme can be availed for the remaining area after excluding the area for which benefit was previously taken, subject to the 4000 sq.m. limit.
3. An area that has previously received benefits from a government scheme will not be eligible for the subsidy again.
4. Small and marginal land-holding farmers, Scheduled Castes/Tribes, women, persons with disabilities, and other farmers approved by the Gram Krishi Vikas Samiti (GKVS) will be selected and given benefits in this order of priority.
## Financial Assistance:
Under the Nanaji Deshmukh Krishi Sanjivani Project, financial assistance will be provided to the beneficiaries for the 'planting material in Polyhouse and shadenet house' component at $50 %$ of the financial norms or $50 %$ of the actual expenditure, whichever is less.

# Inspection (Measurement) Method for Planting Material:
The cost norms for planting material for vegetables and flowers in Polyhouse/shadenet houses are given above on a per sq.m. basis. While conducting the on-site inspection of this component at the field level, the measurement of the area where planting has

actually taken place (in sq.m.) should be taken, and the subsidy should be calculated accordingly. Similarly, the table of cost norms provided above gives a component-wise breakdown of norms. While calculating the subsidy, the maximum cost limit for the respective component will be as given in the above table. The extra cost incurred on one component should not be considered for another component. Also, the subsidy calculation should only consider the components that the beneficiary has actually implemented, as given in the table.
