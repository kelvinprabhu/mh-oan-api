# Nanaji Deshmukh Krishi Sanjivani Prakalp Phase 2.0
## Bamboo Plantation (Individual Benefit) Guidelines
## Introduction:
Climate change is having an adverse effect on the state's agriculture, and the scope of this impact is expected to increase in the future, as noted in the state's Climate Change Action Plan. Farmers in Marathwada and Vidarbha have been facing severe droughts for the past few years, which is adversely affecting groundwater reserves and soil health. Consequently, the productivity of agricultural crops is decreasing. This adverse situation is observed to have a negative impact on the productivity of smallholder farmers. The second phase of the Nanaji Deshmukh Krishi Sanjivani Prakalp has been launched by the Maharashtra government with financial assistance from the World Bank, with the objective of empowering farmers to adapt to the situation arising from climate change.
Under this project, priority has been given to the bamboo plantation component under the agroforestry system. Bamboo is considered an excellent renewable biofuel resource, suitable for wood and paper. Bamboo plantation under the project will help in stabilizing carbon gases that cause climate change, and will also contribute to raising the economic standard of living of farmers by establishing other small bamboo-based industries.
## 1. Objectives
The objectives of the bamboo plantation component included in the Nanaji Deshmukh Krishi Sanjivani Prakalp for the selected village clusters are as follows:
1. To increase tree cover, conserve soil organic matter, and increase productivity from crops and cropping systems to reduce the adverse effects of carbon emissions in the atmosphere.
2. To stop soil erosion and increase soil fertility.
3. To increase the area under bamboo plantation as a supplement to agricultural crops.
4. To increase crop productivity in a complementary and integrated manner by increasing the area under agroforestry-based bamboo plantation, to provide opportunities for employment and income, and to encourage the improvement of the standard of living of small and marginal farmers in rural areas.
5. To popularize suitable/model methods for bamboo according to different agroecological regions and land use situations.
6. To assist in the expansion and capacity building of the area under agroforestrybased bamboo plantation.
## 2. Beneficiary Eligibility Criteria

2.1. It is intended to undertake bamboo plantation under the agroforestry system on the individual land of farmers. Under this, bamboo plantation will be encouraged in the beneficiary's farm, on fallow land, on the farm bunds, and on the bunds of individual/community farm ponds.
2.2. It is necessary for the farmer to have a $7 / 12$ extract in his/her own name. However, if the beneficiary is a joint landholder on the $7 / 12$ extract, a consent letter from all other landholders for bamboo plantation will be mandatory.
2.3. If the land falls under the tenancy law, and if the tenant's name is on the $7 / 12$ extract, the tenant's consent letter will be required to implement the component.
2.4. Farmers holding a minimum of 0.10 ha. to a maximum of 5 ha. of land will be eligible to avail the benefit of this component.
2.5. If the selected beneficiary has previously availed benefits under other government schemes for plantation (Orchard/Tree/Bamboo etc.), the beneficiary will be eligible for the remaining area after excluding the area for which the benefit was availed from the maximum limit of 5 ha.
