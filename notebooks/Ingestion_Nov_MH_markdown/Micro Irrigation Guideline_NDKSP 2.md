# Guidelines for Micro-Irrigation Component
## Introduction:
The adverse effects of climate change are visible on the agriculture sector of the state, and it is mentioned in the state's Climate Change Action Plan that the extent of these effects will increase in the future. Farmers in the Marathwada and Vidarbha regions have been facing severe droughts for the past few years, leading to adverse effects on groundwater reserves and soil health. Consequently, the productivity of agricultural crops is decreasing. The Nanaji Deshmukh Krishi Sanjivani Project has been initiated by the Maharashtra Government with financial assistance from the World Bank with the objective of enabling farmers to adapt to the situation arising from climate change.
The Central Government has issued Operational Guidelines in the year 2024 for implementing the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana - Per Drop More Crop, a centrally sponsored micro-irrigation scheme. This scheme is being implemented from the year 2022-23 under the name Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana - Per Drop More Crop. The Commissionerate of Agriculture, vide letter no. JA.KR. KUA/FALO4/SUSIYO/MA.SU./26359 dated 25/10/2024, has issued guidelines for the microirrigation scheme. On the lines of this scheme, a micro-irrigation scheme (Drip and Sprinkler Irrigation) will be implemented under the Nanaji Deshmukh Krishi Sanjivani Project. Accordingly, the following guidelines are being issued for implementing the approved micro-irrigation component in the villages selected under the project.
## Objectives:
1. To increase the area under micro-irrigation by using modern technology in the project districts and to promote climate-resilient farming practices.
2. To encourage micro-irrigation methods for the development of agriculture and horticulture crops based on modern technology.
3. To manage fertilizers through the micro-irrigation system.
4. To increase agricultural production, the quality of agricultural produce, and consequently, the total income of farmers.
5. To increase water use efficiency.
## Beneficiary Selection Criteria:
1. Under the project, for the micro-irrigation component, beneficiaries will be selected from farmers holding up to $$ hectares of land in the priority order of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Women, Persons with Disabilities, and General category.
2. The farmer should have a $7 / 12$ and 8 -A extract in their own name as proof of land ownership.

3. It is necessary for the farmer to have irrigation facilities.
4. A beneficiary farmer with a joint landholding must submit a consent letter from the other co-holders, which should be on plain paper.
5. A beneficiary farmer will be eligible for a subsidy for a maximum area of $$ hectares.
6. If a farmer has previously availed subsidy for an area less than 5.00 hectares, they can avail the subsidy for the remaining area, up to the 5.00 -hectare limit.
7. If a farmer has previously availed subsidy for micro-irrigation on a particular plot of land, they will be eligible for the subsidy again for the same micro-irrigation component on the same plot of land after a period of 7 years.
8. 8. If a farmer has availed the benefit of the Portable Sprinkler (movable sprinkler set) component under the micro-irrigation scheme, the said farmer can avail the benefit of a drip irrigation set on the "same field" after three years. The subsidy will be provided for the drip irrigation set as per the Effective Differential Subsidy. (A farmer who has availed the benefit of a micro-sprinkler or mini-sprinkler will not be eligible for a subsidy for drip irrigation on the same field after three years).
