# Water Lifting Devices - Pump Set and Pipe
## Introduction:
The adverse effects of climate change are visible on the state's agriculture, and the scope of these effects is expected to widen in the future, as mentioned in the state's Climate Change Action Plan for Agriculture. Farmers in Marathwada and Vidarbha have been facing severe droughts for the past few years, which has adversely affected groundwater levels and soil health. Consequently, the productivity of crops has declined. In this adverse situation, it has been observed that the production of very small and small landholder farmers is adversely affected. The Nanaji Deshmukh Krishi Sanjivani Prakalp has been initiated by the Government of Maharashtra with financial assistance from the World Bank with the objective of enabling farmers to adapt to the situation arising from climate change.
To increase productivity in the state's rainfed agriculture through protective irrigation, protective irrigation facilities have been implemented under subsidy through various schemes in the past. This has helped in increasing the production and income of farmers, thereby raising their standard of living. Considering the current drought-like situation in the state and to create a system for farmers to provide protective irrigation to crops, it is proposed to implement the "Pump Set and Pipe" component as an individual benefit component under the World Bank-aided Nanaji Deshmukh Krishi Sanjivani Prakalp.
## Objectives:
1. To enable farmers from Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the village clusters included in the Nanaji Deshmukh Krishi Sanjivani Prakalp to adapt to the situation arising from climate change.
2. To create a facility for protective irrigation by using water lifting devices.
## Beneficiary Selection Criteria:
1. Under the project, only farmers from Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes with land holdings up to 5 hectares will be eligible for this component.
2. The benefit of this component can be availed by only one person in the family.
3. Farmers who have water available for irrigation but are experiencing a decrease in crop production due to the lack of water lifting devices will be given the benefit.
4. Farmers who have water lifting devices available or have availed benefits for this component from any other scheme will not be eligible for the benefit.

# Financial Assistance:
The details of the permissible subsidy for the Water Lifting Devices component, including Electric Pump Set/Diesel Engine Pump Set and Pipe, to be implemented under the Nanaji Deshmukh Krishi Sanjivani Prakalp are as follows-
