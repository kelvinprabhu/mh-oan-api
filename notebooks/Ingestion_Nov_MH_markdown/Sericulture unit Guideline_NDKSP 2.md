# Sericulture Unit
## Introduction:
Climate change is having an adverse effect on the state's agriculture, and its impact is expected to widen in the future, as noted in the state's Climate Change Action Plan for Agriculture. Farmers in Marathwada and Vidarbha have been facing severe droughts for the past few years, which is adversely affecting groundwater reserves and soil health. Consequently, the productivity of agricultural crops is decreasing. This adverse situation is observed to have a negative impact on the productivity of very small and small landholder farmers.
The sericulture unit is based on agriculture and forest resources and has a large potential for employment. In the areas selected under the project, there is a favourable environment for this unit, offering significant scope for silk production. This unit, along with increasing the agricultural development rate, helps in raising the standard of living of the rural population. The sericulture unit is being promoted through various schemes of the Central and State Governments, such as Silk Samagra-2 and MGNREGA. This component also received a good response in Phase 1 of the Nanaji Deshmukh Krishi Sanjivani Prakalp. To empower farmers to adapt to the situation arising from climate change, this component has been included in the Nanaji Deshmukh Krishi Sanjivani Prakalp for the promotion and expansion of the sericulture component.
## Objectives:
1. To create a source of sustainable income for the farmers in the village clusters covered under the project through the sericulture unit and increase their income.
2. To achieve comprehensive cluster-based development of the sericulture unit.
3. To increase the participation of women in mulberry production and the sericulture unit.
4. To create self-employment opportunities through the sericulture unit.
## Beneficiary Selection Criteria:
1. Farmers holding up to 5 hectares of land under the project will be eligible for this component.
2. The benefit of this sericulture unit component can be availed by only one person in a family.
3. For mulberry cultivation under the project, the beneficiary must have a minimum land holding of 0.40 hectares.
4. The interested beneficiary should have medium to heavy land with good water drainage.

5. Adequate irrigation facilities must be available for the area under mulberry cultivation.
6. If the beneficiary has previously availed benefits for the sericulture unit component from other government schemes, they will not be eligible.
# General Instructions
1. Under the project, the Sericulture Unit item includes the following 3 components.
- Mulberry Plantation
- Construction of Silkworm Rearing House
- Silkworm Rearing and Disinfection Equipment
2. The implementation of the 3 components included in the sericulture unit is to be done in a phased manner. In the first phase, the beneficiary will undertake mulberry plantation on the farm, followed by the implementation of silkworm rearing house construction and silkworm rearing and disinfection equipment.
3. Keeping the above sequence in mind, the officer conducting the site inspection and giving pre-sanction must ensure that the work of the previous phase component of the beneficiary is completed before granting approval. A. E.g., i. If the beneficiary has applied for the silkworm rearing house construction component, it should be confirmed that the beneficiary has undertaken mulberry plantation.
ii. If the beneficiary has applied for silkworm rearing and disinfection equipment, it should be confirmed that the mulberry plantation and silkworm rearing house construction work are completed.
4. It is necessary to construct a silkworm rearing house of $60 22$ feet (length $x$ width), i.e., 1320 sq. ft., and it is mandatory to build a leaf storage room of at least 10x8 feet within it.
5. It is necessary to build a disinfection tank (with plaster, $5 4 3$ feet) in the vicinity of the silkworm rearing house.
6. The benefit of this component under the project will be given on a priority basis to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, women, persons with disabilities, and general category farmers.
## Included Components and Financial Assistance under the Sericulture Unit Component:
