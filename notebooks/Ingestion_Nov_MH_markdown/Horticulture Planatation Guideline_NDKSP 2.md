# Nanaji Deshmukh Krishi Sanjivani Prakalp Phase 2.0
## Horticulture Plantation Guidelines
## Introduction
The adverse effects of climate change are visible on the state's agriculture, and the scope of these effects is expected to widen in the future, as mentioned in the state's Climate Change Action Plan for Agriculture. Farmers in Marathwada and Vidarbha have been facing severe droughts for the past few years, which has adversely affected groundwater levels and soil health. Consequently, the productivity of crops has declined. In this adverse situation, it has been observed that the production of smallholder farmers is adversely affected. The second phase of the Nanaji Deshmukh Krishi Sanjivani Prakalp has been initiated by the Government of Maharashtra with financial assistance from the World Bank with the objective of enabling farmers to adapt to the situation arising from climate change.
The increased level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is an important factor associated with climate change. The plantation of fruit orchards (perennial trees) is very effective in the process of sequestering this carbon dioxide (Carbon Sequestration). Along with the economic upliftment of farmers, sequestering the carbon dioxide that causes climate change is an objective of this project.
## 1. Objectives
1.1. To expand climate-resilient farming practices through the plantation of long-term income-generating fruit crops.
1.2. To achieve the objective of increasing farmers' income by generating regular and maximum income from horticulture plantation.
1.3. To establish orchards of long-term, income-generating fruit crops that survive on less water, providing a supplementary business to rainfed agriculture.
1.4. To reduce soil erosion and promote the conservation of green cover.
1.5. To increase Carbon Sequestration.
## 2. Beneficiary Eligibility Criteria
2.1. Benefits under the project should be given only to individual farmers; institutional beneficiaries will not be eligible for benefits.
2.2. It is necessary for the farmer to have a $7 / 12$ extract in his/her own name. However, if the beneficiary is a joint landholder on the $7 / 12$ extract, a consent letter from all other landholders for the horticulture plantation will be mandatory.

2.3. If the land falls under the Tenancy Act and the name of the tenant is on the 7/12 extract, the tenant's consent letter will be required to implement this component.
2.4. Farmers with land holdings from a minimum of 0.10 ha to a maximum of 5 ha will be eligible for the benefit of this component.
2.5. If the selected beneficiary has previously received government subsidy under any other plantation scheme (fruit orchard/tree/bamboo, etc.), the area for which the benefit was received will be excluded from the maximum limit of 5 ha , and the beneficiary will be eligible for the remaining area.
2.6. Within the maximum area limit, the beneficiary can plant more than one fruit crop as per their wish.
# 3. Included Components and Financial Assistance Ratio
