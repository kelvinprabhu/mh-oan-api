# Guidelines for Inland Fishery
## Introduction:
The adverse effects of climate change are visible on the state's agriculture, and the scope of these effects is expected to widen in the future, as mentioned in the state's Climate Change Action Plan for Agriculture. Farmers in Marathwada and Vidarbha have been facing severe droughts for the past few years, which has adversely affected groundwater levels and soil health. Consequently, the productivity of crops has declined. In this adverse situation, it has been observed that the production of very small and small landholder farmers is adversely affected. The Nanaji Deshmukh Krishi Sanjivani Prakalp has been initiated by the Government of Maharashtra with financial assistance from the World Bank with the objective of enabling farmers to adapt to the situation arising from climate change.
In the rainfed farming areas of the state, farm ponds are constructed through various schemes for protective irrigation. If these available farm ponds are used by farmers for freshwater fish farming as a supplementary business along with protective irrigation for crops, it will help in increasing the production and income of the farmers, thereby raising their standard of living. Accordingly, the "Inland Fishery" component has been included as an individual benefit component under the World Bank-aided Nanaji Deshmukh Krishi Sanjivani Prakalp.
## Objectives:
1. To enable farmers in the village clusters included in the Nanaji Deshmukh Krishi Sanjivani Prakalp to adapt to the situation arising from climate change.
2. To develop fish farming by efficiently using available natural resources for direct production and to increase employment.
3. To raise the standard of living of farmers through inland fishery as a supplementary business along with protective irrigation.
## Beneficiary Selection Criteria:
1. Under the project, farmers with landholdings up to 5 hectares will be selected in the order of priority: Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, women, disabled, and other farmers, and the benefit will be provided.
2. Farmers who have community farm ponds or individual farm ponds will be given the benefit.
3. Farmers who have received benefits for the fish farming component from any other scheme will not be eligible for this benefit.
4. It is necessary for the farmer to have water storage for at least eight to ten months.

# Financial Assistance:
The details of the expected cost and permissible subsidy for the inland fishery component to be implemented under the Nanaji Deshmukh Krishi Sanjivani Prakalp, based on the size of the farm pond, are given in Annexure-1. The permissible subsidy limit under the project will be as follows-
Sr.
No. | Beneficiary | Subsidy Limit
1. | Farmers from Scheduled Caste and
Scheduled Tribe categories and
Women | 60 percent of the financial norms or 60
percent of the actual expenditure,
whichever is less
2. | Farmers from the general category | 40 percent of the financial norms or 40
percent of the actual expenditure,
whichever is less
## General Instructions for Implementing the Freshwater Fish Farming Component -
1. Fast-growing fish species in freshwater, namely Katala, Rohu, Mrigal, Chandera, Gavatya, and Cyprinus, etc., should be reared.
2. For fish farming, if the acidity index $()$ of the pond water is between 7 to 8.5 , the fish grow well. If necessary, lime should be mixed in the water.
3. If the water temperature in the farm pond is between 24 to 32 degrees Celsius, the growth of fish is excellent.
4. In farm ponds without lining, to maintain the natural productivity of the water, fresh cow dung should be added as organic manure. Later, urea and single super phosphate should be added, followed by releasing fingerlings.
5. In farm ponds with plastic covering/lining, fertilizers should not be used. Since the plastic covering/lining affects the production of natural food, it is necessary to provide protein-rich food for the growth of the fish.
6. While practicing fish farming in farm ponds, stocking is done at a rate of 5,000 to 10,000 fingerlings per hectare.
7. In composite fish culture, Indian major carps like Rohu, Katala, Mrigal can be reared along with Chinese carps (Gavatya and Chandera) and Common carp (Cyprinus fish), etc.
8. Assuming an $80 %$ survival rate for fish seed, the seed should be purchased accordingly.
9. Rice bran, groundnut cake, maize grits, soybean meal, and wheat bran are used as supplementary feed for fish.
10. In the initial period, as the growth is faster, it is necessary to provide more feed to the fish. Subsequently, as the rate of growth decreases, the amount of feed is reduced accordingly.

# Implementation Procedure: Responsibilities at Various Levels-
## Beneficiary
1. Interested farmers should register online, submit an application, and upload the necessary documents on the website of the Nanaji Deshmukh Krishi Sanjivani Prakalp.
2. It is mandatory for the farmer to have a farm pond and a suitable water lifting device (pump set) for fish farming. No subsidy will be payable for the farm pond or water lifting device under this component.
3. Feed management according to the age of the fish in the farm pond is expected.
4. In lined farm ponds used for fish farming, the water properties (temperature, pH , etc.) change constantly. Therefore, the responsibility of using the pond water for agriculture and refilling it with fresh water will lie with the respective beneficiary.
5. When purchasing fish seed, the beneficiary should purchase it from the nearest government fish seed centre of the Fisheries Department or, at their own responsibility, from a private fish seed centre of their choice.
6. The responsibility for marketing the fish produced after fish farming in the farm pond will lie with the beneficiary.
7. It is mandatory for the beneficiary to complete the implementation of this component within 30 days from the date of receiving pre-sanction and apply for the subsidy through the DBT portal; otherwise, the pre-sanction given will be cancelled.
8. While applying for the online subsidy, the beneficiary should upload the original, self-attested purchase invoices for fish seed, feed, fertilizers, and necessary materials.
