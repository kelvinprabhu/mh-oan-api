# Individual Farm Ponds
## (Farm Ponds with Inlet Outlet / Farm Ponds without Inlet Outlet)
## Introduction:
Climate change is adversely affecting agriculture in the state, particularly in the Marathwada and Vidarbha regions, where farmers are facing drought, declining groundwater levels, and deterioration of soil health, resulting in reduced crop productivity. Additionally, in the rain-fed and dryland farming areas of the state, farmpond schemes are being implemented with subsidies to enhance productivity through watershed and water-conservation measures, which have helped improve farmers' production, income, and standard of living. In adverse conditions, climate change has a significant impact on small and marginal farmers, and to enable them to adapt to these challenges, the Government of Maharashtra, with assistance from the World Bank, has undertaken the Nanaji Deshmukh Krishi Sanjivani Project.
About 82 percent of agriculture in the state is rain-fed, and uneven as well as uncertain rainfall patterns are major challenges. Due to the lack of irrigation, crop production decreases, and sometimes crops fail completely, causing financial losses to farmers. As a solution, it is necessary to store excess water flowing through streams, drains, and rivers during the monsoon in farm ponds to create assured irrigation facilities. Considering the current drought-like situation in the state, it is proposed to implement the 'Individual Farm Pond' component under the Nanaji Deshmukh Krishi Sanjivani Project with financial assistance from the World Bank, so that farmers can be provided with assured irrigation facilities.
## Objectives:
1. To empower small and marginal farmers in the villages selected under the project to adapt to the situation arising from climate change.
2. To create a facility for protective irrigation.
3. To increase the area under a second crop and to increase the farmer's income.
4. To encourage supplementary farming activities like horticulture, vegetable crops, pisciculture, orchards, and animal husbandry through farm ponds.
5. To contribute to improving the groundwater level by conserving water resources.
## Beneficiary Selection Criteria:
1. Beneficiaries will be selected from among farmers holding up to 5 hectares of land for the individual farm pond component under the project, in the priority order of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Women, Persons with Disabilities, and General.

2. The farmer should have a minimum of 0.40 hectares of land in his/her own name.
3. A suitable site as per the technical criteria for the selected size of the farm pond must be available with the beneficiary.
4. The applicant farmer should not have previously availed a government subsidy for the farm pond component under schemes like 'Magel Tyala Shettale' (Farm pond on demand), collective farm ponds, or 'Bodi' in paddy fields, or any other government scheme.
# Technical Criteria for Farm Pond Site Selection:
1. Select a site where the soil has low water seepage.
2. Black soil with a high clay content is suitable for farm ponds, so such soil should be selected.
3. A site with sandy, porous rock should not be selected for a farm pond.
4. Farm ponds should preferably be constructed in watershed areas where area treatment works have been completed.
5. Farm ponds should be constructed where the land slope is generally within 3 percent.
6. Farm ponds should not be constructed in the flow of a stream/rivulet.
7. For farm ponds with an inlet/outlet, it is mandatory that the incoming water (runoff) from the watershed area is more than the water storage capacity of the farm pond.
8. For farm ponds without an inlet/outlet, it should be confirmed that there is additional runoff/water available for recharge.
9. Farm ponds should be constructed in the benefit areas of drought-prone regions. For this, the terms and conditions of the Water Resources Department's G.R. No. CDA-1015/26/15/LAS (Works), dated 12th March 2015, will apply.
10. Sites where the surrounding land may become waterlogged and marshy, and where water seepage from the farm pond may cause damage to the immovable/movable property of adjacent farmers, should not be selected.
11. While determining the size of the farm pond, the area occupied for creating an embankment around the farm pond with the excavated soil and the privately owned area should be considered.

Individual Farm Pond Size and Excavation Volume-wise Financial Assistance: Under this component, a farm pond of any one of the following various sizes can be applied for. The details of the expected excavation and subsidy for each size of farm pond are as follows.
