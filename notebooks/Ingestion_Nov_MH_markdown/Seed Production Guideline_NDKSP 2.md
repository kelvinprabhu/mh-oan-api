# Production of Foundation and Certified Seeds of Climate-Resilient Varieties
## Introduction:
Through the Nanaji Deshmukh Krishi Sanjivani Project, climate-resilient farming technology is being disseminated in 7201 villages in all districts of Marathwada and Vidarbha, as well as Jalgaon and Nashik districts. For this, along with climate-resilient technology, basic infrastructure is also being provided to the farmers. The use of quality seeds is essential for increasing the production and productivity of major crops grown in the project area. For this, it is imperative to increase the seed replacement rate for pulses, oilseeds, and cereal crops in the project area. Therefore, special efforts are being made under the project to make seeds of climate-resilient varieties of major crops available to farmers. In climate-resilient varieties, emphasis should be placed on short-duration varieties, pest and disease-resistant or tolerant varieties, drought-tolerant varieties, etc. Additionally, the quality of the produced variety must also be appropriate for the market.
With the objective of strengthening the seed production chain of major crops in the project area, the following component is being implemented under the project.
## A. Promoting the production of foundation and certified seeds of climate-resilient varieties
## Objectives:
1. To make seeds of climate-resilient varieties of major crops available in the villages within the project area.
2. To increase the participation of small farmers in the seed production chain of climate-resilient varieties.
3. To empower seed-producing farmers and Farmer Producer Companies to create economic stability.
## Implementation Procedure
## Selection of Climate-Resilient Varieties and Registration of Seed Production Program:
1. Considering the important crops of the project district, climate-resilient varieties recommended for the state by the State Agricultural Universities and relevant national crop research institutes should be used for the seed production program and technology dissemination. A list of such varieties is attached. Besides this, other climate-resilient seed production programs can be implemented based on the technical guidance of scientists from Agricultural Universities/Krishi Vigyan Kendras and district representatives of the Maharashtra State Seeds Corporation (Mahabeej), and as per farmer preference. For this, the characteristics of the

climate-resilient varieties selected for seed production must be specified and communicated to the project management unit.
2. Climate-resilient traits include being tolerant/resistant to pests and diseases, tolerant to moisture stress, short duration, tolerant to salt stress, suitable for mechanical harvesting, and giving higher yields in dryland areas.
3. The seed production program in the state is regulated under the Seed Act, 1968, and the Indian Minimum Seed Certification Standards, 1988 and 2013. For this, the Maharashtra State Seed Certification Agency announces the season-wise registration process for the seed production program, and seed producers are registered. As directed by the Central and State Governments, the use of the SATHI portal for the implementation and monitoring of the seed production program is mandatory.
4. Government, cooperative, semi-government institutions, Farmer Producer Companies, as well as individual farmers or farmer groups with a license to sell seeds, can register directly with the seed certification agency for seed certification.
# Beneficiary Selection and Subsidy Eligibility:
1. Financial assistance will be provided under this component for the registered seed production program of climate-resilient varieties of crops in the project area. Farmers participating in the seed production program of government, cooperative, semi-government institutions, or Farmer Producer Companies, as well as farmers undertaking the seed production program by registering directly on the SATHI portal with the seed certification agency, will be eligible for the subsidy under this component.
2. To encourage farmers in the project villages to undertake seed production and to bring maximum area under seed production of climate-resilient varieties, there will be no landholding limit for farmers willing to undertake seed production. The area under actual seed production out of the area registered on the SATHI portal with the seed certification agency will be eligible for financial assistance.
3. The farmer must have an assured protected irrigation source available.
4. The interested farmer should have acquired skills related to seed production or should show readiness to undergo skill training.
5. The Project Director (ATMA) shall organize a one-day pre-season training for seed producers/interested farmers in coordination with Mahabeej and the Seed Certification Agency, as well as in collaboration with the Agricultural University and Krishi Vigyan Kendra. The norms for training expenditure will be applicable as per the instructions under the project's training component.

# Items covered for financial assistance:
The following items are included for financial assistance under this component. A. The cost of breeder/foundation seed paid by the seed producer for foundation/certified seed production.
B. The fees charged by the seed certification agency for the production of foundation/certified seed (registration fee, inspection fee, etc.). Apart from these two items, financial assistance for other expenses incurred by the farmer for seed production will not be applicable under this sub-component.
## Subsidy Limit
Under this project, for the foundation/certified seed production component, financial assistance will be payable at $100 %$ of the actual expenditure on the included items, up to a maximum limit of Rs. 15,000/- per hectare.
For a single landholder, this financial assistance will be permissible for a maximum of 10 hectares of seed production area in one season, with a maximum limit of Rs. 1.5 lakh. For calculating the subsidy for foundation seed production under this component, if the concerned applicant has purchased the breeder seed from the Agricultural University, the sale price of the breeder seed as per the rates fixed by the Central Government for the Agricultural University shall be considered. If the applicant has purchased the breeder seed from Mahabeej, the sale price of the breeder seed as per the rates fixed by Mahabeej shall be considered. Similarly, for calculating the subsidy for certified seed production, the sale price of foundation seed as fixed for the respective year by the Agricultural University and Mahabeej shall be considered.
## Component Implementation Procedure
