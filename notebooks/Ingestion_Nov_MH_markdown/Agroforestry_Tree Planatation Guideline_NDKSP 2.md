# Nanaji Deshmukh Krishi Sanjivani Prakalp Phase 2.0 Agroforestry System - Tree Plantation Guidelines
## Introduction:
Climate change is observed to have an adverse impact on the state's agriculture, and the scope of this impact is expected to increase in the future, as noted in the state's Climate Change Action Plan for Agriculture. Farmers in Marathwada and Vidarbha have been facing severe droughts for the past few years, which has adversely affected groundwater reserves and soil health. Consequently, the productivity of agricultural crops is decreasing. This adverse situation is observed to have a negative impact on the productivity of smallholder farmers. The second phase of the Nanaji Deshmukh Krishi Sanjivani Prakalp has been launched by the Government of Maharashtra with financial assistance from the World Bank, with the objective of empowering farmers to adapt to the situation arising from climate change.
The increased level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is a major factor associated with climate change. Tree plantation is a very effective process in the sequestration of this carbon dioxide (Carbon Sequestration). One of the objectives of this project is the sequestration of carbon dioxide, which is responsible for climate change, along with the economic upliftment of farmers. Under this project, priority has been given to the agroforestry-tree plantation component.
## 1. Objectives
The objectives of the Agroforestry - Tree Plantation component, which is included in the Nanaji Deshmukh Krishi Sanjivani Prakalp in the selected village clusters, are as follows:
1. To increase tree cover, conserve soil organic matter, and increase productivity from crops and cropping systems to reduce the adverse effects of carbon emissions in the atmosphere.
2. To increase the area under tree plantation on farms as a supplement to agricultural crops.
3. To increase the productivity of crops and livestock in a complementary and integrated manner by increasing the area under agroforestry-based tree plantation, and to encourage the improvement of the standard of living of small and marginal farmers in rural areas by providing opportunities for employment and income.
4. To popularize suitable/model methods for agroforestry according to different agro-ecological regions and land use situations.
5. To assist in the expansion and capacity building of the area under agroforestrybased tree plantation.

# 2. Beneficiary Eligibility Criteria
2.1. It is intended to undertake tree plantation under the agroforestry system on the individual land of farmers. Under this, tree plantation will be encouraged in the beneficiary's farm, on fallow land, and on the farm bunds.
