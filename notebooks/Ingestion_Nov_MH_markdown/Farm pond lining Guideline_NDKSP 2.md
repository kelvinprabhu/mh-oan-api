# Farm Pond Lining
## Introduction:
The Nanaji Deshmukh Krishi Sanjivani Prakalp has been launched by the Maharashtra government with financial assistance from the World Bank, with the objective of empowering farmers to adapt to the situation arising from climate change. The farm pond scheme is being implemented on a subsidy basis through various schemes to increase productivity in the state's rainfed dryland agriculture through watershed and water conservation.
Most of the dryland farming in the state is dependent on rainfall, and regions like Marathwada, Vidarbha, and East Vidarbha frequently experience low rainfall, uneven distribution, and long dry spells. Due to the lack of irrigation, there is a significant reduction in crop production, and sometimes crops are completely lost, leading to financial losses for farmers. On the other hand, when it rains heavily, runoff water flows through streams and nullahs and goes to waste. As a sustainable solution to this problem, it is very important to store the runoff rainwater in farm ponds and use it for protective irrigation. However, to retain the stored water for a longer period and to prevent wastage of water, lining of the farm ponds is necessary. Farm pond lining prevents water seepage, helps in retaining water, and allows farmers to use it for agriculture as needed. This increases productivity, averts financial losses, and makes farming more sustainable. Therefore, the farm pond lining component is being implemented under this project.
## Objectives:
1. To empower small and marginal farmers in the villages selected under the project to adapt to the situation arising from climate change.
2. To create a facility for protective irrigation, increase the area under a second crop, and increase the farmer's income.
3. To encourage supplementary farming activities like horticulture, vegetable crops, pisciculture, orchards, and animal husbandry through farm ponds.
## Beneficiary Selection Criteria:
1. Beneficiaries will be selected from among farmers holding up to 5 hectares of land for the farm pond lining component under the project, in the priority order of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Women, Persons with Disabilities, and General.
2. It is mandatory for a farm pond without an inlet-outlet, constructed under any government scheme or excavated by the farmer, to exist on the beneficiary's own land.

3. The size of the said farm pond must be a minimum of $15 15 3$ meters (volume 441 cu. m.).
4. The beneficiary should not have previously received a subsidy for the lining component from any government scheme.
# Financial Assistance:
1. For the plastic film lining of farm ponds without an inlet-outlet, financial assistance of $50 %$ of the actual measured cost or ₹ 75,000 , whichever is less, will be payable.
2. Beneficiaries belonging to the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe categories will be eligible for financial assistance of $90 %$ of the actual measured cost or ₹ 75,000 , whichever is less.
3. Under the project, rates fixed for plastic sheet of 500 microns at Rs. 77 per square meter and for sheet installation at Rs. 18 per square meter will be permissible.
