# Nanaji Deshmukh Krishi Sanjivani Prakalp Phase 2.0
## Vermicompost Production Unit and NADEP Compost Production Unit
## Introduction:
The adverse effects of climate change are visible on the state's agriculture, and the scope of these effects is expected to widen in the future, as mentioned in the state's Climate Change Action Plan for Agriculture. Farmers in Marathwada and Vidarbha have been facing severe droughts for the past few years, which has adversely affected groundwater levels and soil health. Consequently, the productivity of crops has declined. This adverse situation has been observed to have a negative impact on the production of smallholder farmers. The Nanaji Deshmukh Krishi Sanjivani Prakalp has been initiated by the Government of Maharashtra with financial assistance from the World Bank with the objective of enabling farmers to adapt to the situation arising from climate change.
Under the organic farming system, conserving nature, reducing crop production costs, and increasing the use of alternative organic and biological inputs for hazardous chemicals like chemical fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, and hormones is the need of the hour. Vermicompost is made from farm waste, plant-based materials, and cow dung by earthworms. Vermicompost contains various bacteria, enzymes, vitamins, and other useful chemicals, which have a positive effect on plant growth.
Similarly, processing farm waste through composting results in the decomposition of its organic matter through biological methods by microorganisms and earthworms, producing excellent humus-like organic compost. If this compost is used extensively in the fields, it will significantly improve soil health and greatly boost agricultural production. It is the need of the hour to prepare organic manure from all plant-based materials generated in the field and return it to the field. Organic manure improves soil texture and water retention capacity, ensuring an adequate supply of nutrients. The soil remains friable, which keeps it aerated. It helps in the growth of beneficial microorganisms in the farm.
In this regard, considering the above matter, it is proposed to implement the Vermicompost Production Unit and NADEP Compost Production Unit as individual benefit components.
